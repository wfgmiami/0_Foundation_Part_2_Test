###Overview

Functional programming is another form of programming that is different than an Object Oriented Style used in earlier test specs. Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions as the primary programming construct, as opposed to OOP, which emphasizes the use of objects. Because of this, Functional Programming often makes use of Higher Order Functions! 

Code written in a functional style strives to be modular, readable, and testable by using pure functions, and avoiding mutating data when possible.  Understanding Functional Programming can make your code easier to read and maintain! Throughout the Functional TestSpecs you will create some of the most popular and used methods in functional languages such as: 

- Map
- Filter
- Any
- Every
- Reduce
- Contains
